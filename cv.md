## Brief information about yourself
___
I have been developing for about a year. I am actively developing in this direction, taking various courses. I like to solve both creative problems and problems related to mathematical calculations and logic, which includes frontend development. Therefore, this field of activity is very interesting to me and there is a great desire to develop further in this direction.

I am a certified specialist in the field of printing. I have work experience (5 years) in a managerial position, which allowed me to develop such qualities as quick decision-making in difficult situations, the ability to quickly
analyze information and work in multitasking mode, the ability to clearly set and distribute tasks. I love to understand the technologies that interest me and I bring the tasks to the end.
